- **Basic Idea**: Chain-of-Thought Prompting involves structuring your prompt to guide the AI in "**thinking out loud**." It means asking the AI to not only provide an answer but also to detail the step-by-step reasoning that leads to that answer.
- **Purpose**: This method is especially useful for complex tasks, like math problems, logic puzzles, or scenarios requiring critical thinking. The chain-of-thought helps in breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts, making it easier for the AI to process and for you to understand the reasoning behind the answer.
- **Example**: "Explain how to calculate the area of a circle with a radius of 5cm, **==step by step==**."
