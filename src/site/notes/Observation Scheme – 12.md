Observation Scheme–12 (OS-12) 是一套根據Calgary-Cambridge Guide (C-CG) 發展的臨床溝通技巧評估工具，目標為透過具體化的評分標準提升對醫療專業人員溝通行為的觀察與評量一致性。

OS-12 包含12個項目，涵蓋會談的六大面向：
- initiating the session
- gathering information
- building the relationship
- explanation and planning
- providing structure
- closing the session.

每項目依據是否展現特定微技巧（micro-skills）給予0到4分不等的評分。

OS-12可應用於音檔評分，特別適合用於臨床溝通訓練成效的前後比較，亦可作為教育評量或研究使用的工具。
