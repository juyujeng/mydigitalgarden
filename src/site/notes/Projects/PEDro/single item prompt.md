# Item 6: Blinding of All Therapists

## Basic prompt

### Details of evaluation

- Aim of evaluation: Determine whether the therapists who administer the therapy are unaware of the treatment group assignment for each subject.
- Criterion for satisfaction: 
    1. Therapists are considered blinded if they cannot discern whether individual subjects received the treatment or a control.
- Examples:
    - satisfied:
        - The clinical practitioners who applied the conventional intervention and those who administered the baseline, postintervention, and follow-up clinical assessments to the intervention groups were blinded.
    - not satisfied: 
        - not mentioned any thing about blinding of therapists.

- Aim of evaluation: Determine whether the therapists who administer the therapy are unaware of the treatment group assignment for each subject.
- Criterion for satisfaction: 
    1. Therapists are considered blinded if they cannot discern whether individual subjects received the treatment or a control.

### Steps for Evaluation:

1. **Check for Blinding Information**: Review the research documentation to identify if it explicitly states that the therapists administering the therapy were blinded to the treatment group assignments.
2. **Evaluate the Blinding Description**: Ensure that the description of blinding specifies that the therapists did not know whether subjects received the treatment or a control.
3. **Document Findings**: Note whether the blinding of therapists is explicitly mentioned and described.

### Examples:
- satisfied:
    - The clinical practitioners who applied the conventional intervention and those who administered the baseline, postintervention, and follow-up clinical assessments to the intervention groups were blinded.
- not satisfied: 
    - not mentioned any thing about blinding of therapists.
    - The therapists were not blinded to the group assignment, given the nature of the interventions.

# Item 7: Blinding of All Assessors

## Basic prompt

### Details of evaluation

- Aim of evaluation: Determine whether the assessors are unaware of the treatment group assignment for each subject.
- Criterion for satisfaction: 
    1. The study must explicitly state in the methods that assessors were unaware of which group subjects were allocated to. In cases where key outcomes are self-reported, the subject is the assessor, and they must be blinded. This blinding of assessors, whether they are subjects providing self-reports or external raters, must be clearly described in the methodology.
- Examples:
    - satisfied:
        - all of the out-come measures were administered to the patients by the same blinded assessor.
    - not satisfied: 
        - This was a randomized controlled trial with no assessor blinding.

- Criterion for satisfaction: 
    1. The study must explicitly state in the methods that assessors were unaware of which group subjects were allocated to. In cases where key outcomes are self-reported, the subject is the assessor, and they must be blinded. This blinding of assessors, whether they are subjects providing self-reports or external raters, must be clearly described in the methodology.

### Steps for Evaluation

1. **Identify Blinding Statement**: Look for a statement in the study that explicitly indicates whether the assessors were unaware of the treatment group assignments.
2. **Evaluate Self-Reported Outcomes**: If key outcomes are self-reported, ensure the study clearly states that subjects (as assessors) were blinded to their group assignments.
3. **Document Findings**: Record whether the blinding of assessors or subjects is explicitly mentioned and described.

### Examples:
- satisfied:
    - all of the out-come measures were administered to the patients by the same blinded assessor.
- not satisfied: 
    - This was a randomized controlled trial with no assessor blinding.

# Item 8: adequate follow up

## Basic prompt


### Details of evaluation

- Aim of evaluation: Determine whether this research has adequate follow-up data points.
- Criterion for satisfaction: 
    1. The report must **explicitly state both** the number of subjects initially allocated to groups and the number of subjects from whom key outcome measures were obtained.
    2. If measures of at least one key outcome were obtained from more than 85% of the subjects initially allocated to groups, then this criterion is satisfied. This means the loss rate for each group should be less than 15%. If the initial numbers of participants for each group and the numbers of participants who completed the study are not well documented, this criterion is not satisfied.
- Examples:
    - satisfied:
        - The study randomly assigned 48 individuals to 3 groups, with 16 people per group. All 16 participants in each group completed the study and their data were analyzed, resulting in a 100% retention rate for each group.
    - not satisfied: 
        - The number of subjects initially allocated to groups and the number of subjects from whom key outcome measures were obtained were not both reported.
        - The follow-up rate for at least one group is less than 85%. For example, if the number of subjects from whom key outcome measures were obtained divided by the number of subjects initially allocated to the group is less than 0.85.

    2. If measures of at least one key outcome were obtained from more than 85% of the subjects initially allocated to groups, then this criterion is satisfied. This means the loss rate for each group should be less than 15%. If the initial numbers of participants for each group and the numbers of participants who completed the study are not well documented, this criterion is not satisfied.

### Steps for evaluation

1. **List Initial Allocation**: Record the number of subjects initially allocated to each group. If not explicitly stated in the article, note it as "not available."
2. **List Final Completion**: Record the number of subjects in each group who completed the study and whose data could be analyzed. If there are multiple follow-up points, list the number of subjects for each time point. If not explicitly stated in the article, note it as "not available."
3. **Calculate Follow-Up Rate**: Calculate the follow-up rate for each group at each time point using the formula: 
    - $$\text{Follow-UpÂ Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Subjects Analyzed}}{\text{Number of Subjects Initially Allocated}}$$
    - Perform this calculation for each time point if multiple follow-up points are provided.
4. **Determine Satisfaction**:
    - If the initial allocation numbers and the completion numbers at each time point are not explicitly stated, mark as "not satisfied."
    - If for any time point, the follow-up rate for each group is 85% or higher, mark as "satisfied."


### Examples:
- satisfied:
    - The study randomly assigned 48 individuals to 3 groups, with 16 people per group. All 16 participants in each group completed the study and their data were analyzed, resulting in a 100% retention rate for each group.
- not satisfied: 
    - The number of subjects initially allocated to groups and the number of subjects from whom key outcome measures were obtained were not both reported.

# Item 9: intention to treat analysis


## Basic prompt


### Details of evaluation

- Aim of evaluation: Determine whether the study uses an Intention to Treat (ITT) analysis to maintain the integrity of random allocation and minimize bias.
- Definition of Intention to Treat Analysis:
    - Intention to treat (ITT) analysis involves analyzing data as if all subjects received the treatment or control condition they were initially allocated, regardless of what actually occurred during the trial. This approach accounts for protocol deviations and maintains the random allocation balance, thereby minimizing bias.
- Criterion for satisfaction: 
    1. The criterion is met if the study explicitly states that an ITT analysis was used. Alternatively, the study can fulfill this requirement if it reports that all subjects received the treatment or control conditions as initially allocated, or that subjects were analyzed according to their initial group allocation.
- Examples:
    - satisfied:
        - An intention-to-treat analysis was performed.
    - not satisfied: 
        - The analysis was conducted using a per-protocol approach, where only participants who completed the study according to the specified treatment protocol were included in the final evaluation. As a result, individuals who dropped out or did not adhere to the assigned treatment were excluded from the analysis.

# Item 10: between-group statistical comparison

## Basic prompt

### Details of evaluation

- Aim of evaluation: Determine whether the study provides results of statistical comparisons between groups for key outcomes.
- Criterion for satisfaction: 
    1. The study must report results of between-group statistical comparisons for at least one key outcome. This can include comparisons of outcomes measured after treatment administration or comparisons of changes over time between groups. The comparisons may involve hypothesis testing (e.g., providing a p-value) or providing estimates (e.g., mean or median differences, differences in proportions, number needed to treat, relative risk, or hazard ratio) along with their confidence intervals.
- Examples:
    - satisfied:
        - Between- group analyses revealed significant differences and large effects among the three groups...
    - not satisfied: 
        - The study only present the differences between different time points within group, but not showed any comparisons between group.
