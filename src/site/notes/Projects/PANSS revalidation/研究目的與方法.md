#  aims of the research

- Revalidate psychometric properties of two versions of the PANSS-MLSF
    -  comparability of the PANSS-MLSF scores with the PANSS scores
        - mean squared error, MSE
    -  concurrent validity
        - Pearson's correlation between PANSS-MLSF and PANSS
    -  convergent validity (if data available)
        - Pearson's correlation between PANSS-MLSF and CGI-S, MMSE, and Lawton IADL 
- Further explore the application of PANSS-MLSF
    - Establish and validate **cutoff points** for clinical categorization
    - Investigate demographic and clinical differences in PANSS-MLSF scores across
        - age?
        - gender?
        - schizoaffective disorder
    - Assess real-world applicability by examining outcomes such as education and employment post-discharge. (responsiveness)
    - test-retest reliability 


# required data

- scores of each item in PANSS
- patients' characteristics
    - age
